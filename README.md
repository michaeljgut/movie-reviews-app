A typical user to this application would be interested in whether or not the NY Times recommends a movie they are considering watching.
They would type in the movie title and get back whether or not the movie was a critics pick or not. They would also get a brief summary
of the movie and any user comments. If they wanted to learn more about the movie, they could then click on a link to the full NY Times movie review article. After watching the movie, the user could then come back and enter whether or not they agreed with the NY Times 
movie review critic as a comment. They would have the ability to edit and delete comments as well by clicking on them.
